...... A host consists of at least one node as (deployedComponents).
...... Each Node is associated with one or more Channel


A Fabric network consists of organizations and channels.
There's at least one organization in each Fabric network.
There's at least one channel in each Fabric network.
An organization participates at least in one channel.
A channel can be a system channel or an application channel.
A Fabric network contains exactly one system channel.

 
A Fabric network either employs a Kafka-based or a Raft-based ordering approach.

 
...... An AbstractOrganization can be a ParticipantOrganization or an OrdererOrganization.
...... ParticipantOrganization contains Node instances and Host instances.
//An organization can be a participant organization or an orderer organization.
An orderer organization can participate only in a system channel.
Fabric Network contains at least one participant organization.

 
A peer is either an endorsing peer or an ordering peer.
An organization owns at least one peer.
An orderer organization owns only ordering peers.


For Kafka-based ordering, there's exactly one orderer organization.
For Kafka-based ordering, participant organizations don't participate in the system channel.
For Kafka-based ordering, participant organizations can't own ordering peers.


For Raft-based ordering, there's no orderer organization.
For Raft-based ordering, all organizations owning ordering peers participate in the system channel.
For Raft-based ordering, the consenter set of an application channel is a subset of the ordering peers.

 
Each channel maintains exactly one channel ledger.
If a peer is a member of a channel, then it maintains a copy of the channel ledger.
If a participant organization participates in a channel, then at least one of its endorsing peers is a member of the channel.
If an endorsing peer is a member of a channel, then its organization participates in the channel.


......PREDICATES AND ERRORS:
-----------------------------------

- ledgerInNodes:  a Ledger is associated with a particular Node within a Channel.

- ordererInOtherChannel: checks whether an OrdererOrganization is part of an ApplicationChannel.

- ordererNodeInNotKafkaNetwork: checks whether a ParticipantOrganization (should contain a Host and the Host should have an OrderingNode) has an OrderingNode deployed in a KafkaFabricNetwork.

- organizationCommunicatingWithChannel: 
	-OrdererOrganization should have an OrderingNode deployed in the channel.
	-ParticipantOrganization should have a Host, the Host should have a Node deployed in the channel (deployedComponents(h, n)).

- participantInSystemChannelForKafka: checks whether a ParticipantOrganization is communicating with a SystemChannel within a KafkaFabricNetwork.
	- (organizationCommunicatingWithChannel(o, s): The organization should be communicating with the specified SystemChannel.)

- participantInSystemChannelForRaft: checks whether a ParticipantOrganization is not communicating with a SystemChannel within a RaftFabricNetwork.
	- (!organizationCommunicatingWithChannel(o, s): The organization should not be communicating with the specified SystemChannel).

- lonelyOrganization: checks if an AbstractOrganization is not communicating with any channel.
